# Full Stack Project - MyDrugs

-A drug prescription app(stores the prescription and the drug info)
-I've thought about this app idea when I personally experienced how impossible it is
to remember the names of the meds/when did I get it/refill?/dr's name?/description/etc.
-Any patients who get prescriptions from a doctor


## User stories

-User can sign up/sign in/sign out/change pw
-User can create(add) a record of a prescription
-User can see all the prescriptions that are stored
-User can update the prescriptions(log side effects, likes/dislikes)
-User can delete(archieve) the prescriptions

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

Day 2 - Working on user - server.js/model/user routes/curl scripts
Day 3 - Working on prescription - server.js/model/prescription routes/curl scripts
